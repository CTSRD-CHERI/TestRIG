# TestRIG

TestRIG is a very basic QuickCheck-based random instruction generator
for RISC-V (currently the RV32I subset).  The name is short for
**Test**ing processors using **R**andom **I**nstruction
**G**eneration.  The main feature of the generator is a small library
that makes it easy to define instruction encoders and decoders.  Why
not
